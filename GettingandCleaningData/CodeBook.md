CodeBook
========================================================
This codebook describes the variables found in the tidy dataset generated by running run_analysis.R

## Data Collection Description

The original data set was obtained from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]

It is described as a "Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors."

The experiments involved 30 subjects. Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) with a sensor-equipped smartphone attached to their waist. The smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope we used to capture 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

See the above website for further details on sensor signal pre-processing if you are interested.

## Original Data Variable Description

This section is taken directly from the "features_info.txt" file included with the original dataset found at the link above. Rather than attempt to describe all the variables one-by-one, I reprint relevant information from that file here for convenience.

"Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ  
tGravityAcc-XYZ  
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
tBodyGyro-XYZ  
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
tBodyAccMag  
tGravityAccMag  
tBodyAccJerkMag  
tBodyGyroMag  
tBodyGyroJerkMag  
fBodyAcc-XYZ  
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
fBodyGyro-XYZ  
fBodyAccMag  
fBodyAccJerkMag  
fBodyGyroMag  
fBodyGyroJerkMag"

The mean value and std deviation were estimated from these signals and these are what we are interested in for our tidy dataset.

## Processing and Resultant Tidy Data

Each record in the original data set contained a 561 dimensional feature vector with time and frequency domain variables, as well as the subject's id, and a label indicated the activity they performed. I have extracted the variables containing the estimated mean and std deviation of the signals - giving a 66 dimensional feature vector (plus subject id and activity label).

As mentioned, there are 30 subjects and 6 activities. To create the tidy data set, I have averaged those mean and standard deviation measurements over subjects and activities. Thus, the tidy dataset has 180 records (30 subjects * 6 activities).

## Complete list of variables by column number

Note that I have cleaned the original variable names for better readability/understanding.  See the 'Style' section in README for more info if necessary.
